# Day_Dreamer_Game
A terminal game I created for Codedex.io's Python course.
It's a text-based adventure with two parts:
The first has you live out the day in the life of someone working a dead-end job. You'll be given various scenarios that allow you to choose how you respond to them.
Your choices will impact the second half of the game: the dream world. In this section, you'll have to fight through a nightmare, using RPG-style commands.
